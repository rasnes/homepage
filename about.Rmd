Hi, I am Rasmus Nes, a data scientist situated in Oslo, Norway. I made this homepage for making it easy to occasionally share some thoughts or experiences from my work or side projects.

The page is made with [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) and hosted on [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).
