I thought I might briefly share why I've chosen [Distill for R Markdown](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) as the "framework" for my homepage, and why I prefer to host it on on [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/).

## Why Distill for `R` Markdown

Most importantly, it is _really_ easy to set up and deploy (kudos to the RStudio team). After having made an RStudio project of a [Distill blog](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/blog.html), it is very easy to add blog posts from within RStudio and then push to Github (more on Github integration with Firebase below).

[Thomas Mock's summary on Pros and Cons of `R distill`](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/#why-consider-distill) sums it up nicely:

- **No Hugo or other build dependencies.** If I want to add a new blog post, I simply write a new distill R Markdown document and compile/Knit it to static HTML. This as little overhead as I can imagine. 
- **No version dependencies.** I am not sure I'll blog very often, but when I do I want it to be hassle-free; I want to focus all my time and effort on making the blog post, not getting the blog to work. Even though, say, my next blog post will be in two years time, I could confidently update all my `R` packages and be sure that as long as my blog post compiles to HTML it can easily be added to my blog. This is in contrast to frameworks like Hugo, where you'd risk running into compatibility issues and you'd need to occasionally update your Hugo version etc. (with the risk of screwing things up since I've long since forgotten how to set up this damn blog.)
- **`distill::import_post()`**


- Static HTML page


and then either push it to [my repo](https://github.com/rasnes/homepage) or to some other repo from which I can use the `distill::import_post()`
